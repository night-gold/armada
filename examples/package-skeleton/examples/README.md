# Examples folder

This folder should contain examples of overlays for deploying the app, by default only a kustomize file but it could contain ingress specific configuration.

Each folder can also have documentation specifics for deploying configuration with custom conf for cloud, like storage.

## Folders

The overlays example name should describe what example it's giving for example: `nginx-ingress`.
